        <h2>Problem Statement: Ubearable Gym Wait Times</h2>
        <p>
          The increased interest in the gym on campus has caused the wait times to utilize gym equipment to grow exponentially, and it has become overcrowded.

          <p>
            Our affinity diagram tackled 5 main subjects of thought. We had our ideas on how we would start up our company/technology, the ideas revolving around how the product worked and where we would go with the project; whether that was taking it to a more physical side on the gym machines themselves or sticking witht the idea of an app and using nfc tags or QR codes. We also brainstormed about partnerships either with gym equipment companies, gym chains like Golds or Planet Fitness, and what partnerships with colleges would look like and how they would benefit us. Lastly our final two branches of thought were any open questions we had about our products mainly focusing on the buisness aspect and advertisment and how we would go about approaching that.
